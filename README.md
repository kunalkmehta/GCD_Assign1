# GCD_Assign1
course Project 1 files
Thank you so much for taking your time out to read this, I know reading a README can be pretty boring and not to 
mention, "useless". But I believe it can be the best place to understand what to expect, especially if you are about to look 
into someone else's code, or may be trying to evaluate it ;)

Anyways, this detailed explanation about the code, process, problem statement, assumptions etc is given in codebook.md. Please read this before you see the code. 

Explanation of the code and the steps is also given in the run_analysis.R in comments. 

I had a lot of fun creating this assignment, hpe you won't find it funny while evaluating it :)

Cheers, and best of luck.
